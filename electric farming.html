        <p>Hydroponics is the technique of growing plants
        using a water-based nutrient solution rather than 
        soil, and can include an aggregate substrate, or 
        growing media, such as vermiculite, coconut coir, 
        or perlite. Hydroponic production systems are used 
        by small farmers, hobbyists, and commercial 
        enterprises.Hydroponic cultures lead to highest 
        biomass and protein production compared to other
        growth substrates, of plants cultivated in the same 
        environmental conditions and supplied with equal amounts
        of nutrients.Since hydroponic growing takes much less water
        and nutrients to grow produce, and climate change threatens
        agricultural yields, it could be possible in the future for 
        people in harsh environments with little accessible water to 
        hydroponically grow their own plant-based food.Hydroponics is
        not only used on Earth, but has also proven itself in plant 
        production experiments in space.To grow hydroponically, you 
        need plants, a container, water, a way to anchor the plants,
        nutrients and a light source. It is possible to grow vegetables 
        hydroponically both outdoors and indoors. If growing indoors,
        artificial lighting will help faster growth.</p>

        <h1>How To Setup A Hydroponics Farm</h1>
      
            
               <h2>1. Find a suitable container for the system:</h2><p>Many find 
                that deeper storage containers and buckets work well for 
                hese systems because the deeper the reservoir of water, the 
                more stable the nutrient solution will be. Light should not
                be able to penetrate your container, otherwise there is a high 
                risk that algae will grow in your water.</p>
              
                <br>

            <h2> 2. Drill holes into the lid of the container:</h2><p>The plants
            will grow in net pots, these are pots with plenty of holes for roots 
            to grow through. The next step is to drill holes into the lid of the 
            container where the net pots will sit. This requires the only specialist 
            tool you'll need in this build, a hole saw, these are quite affordable 
            and easy to use. The size of net pots you use must be larger than the hole 
            so they don't fall through.Keepthe holes apart to accommodate for the size 
            of the mature plants. </p>
          
            <br>
            <h2>3. Assemble your air pump :</h2><p>The air pump must remain outside of the reservoir. 
            It will come with a check valve, this ensures that the pump does not suck water back up
            if it is turned off. If it does not come with one, you must keep the pump above the water
            level. Connect the air stone and check valve with a length of tubing, ensuring the arrow
            on the check valve faces the air stone. Then connect the check valve to the air pump in 
            the same manner.
            <br>
            <h2>2. Fill the reservoir, add nutrients and adjust the pH:</h2>The system can be quite heavy when full, 
            so make sure you decide where your container will live before filling it up! Fill it almost full with water, 
            leaving 1-2cm of space at the top. Next you need to add your hydroponic nutrients to the water, 
            following the instructions on your bottle.  We also need to adjust the pH of the water. Using a pH meter, 
            measure the pH. Most vegetables and herbs require a slightly acidic nutrient solution. 
            <br>
            <h2>5. Assemble the system :</h2>Plug in the air pump and place the air stone in the reservoir. 
            Secure the lid on top.Adding your plants is simple, 
            place some plants into the net pots. You can use seedlings grown in soil.</p>
           
            <h2>How To Maintain The Hydroponics System</h2>
            <p><i>We recommend changing the water in your system and reservoir every 7-10 days to replenish depleted 
                nutrients with fresh. If you do not sterilise your system, you risk breeding algae and fungi, leading
                to root rot and unhealthy plants.An EC meter will become one of your best friends when it comes to 
                maintaining your hydroponic reservoir. These meters will give you an idea of the amount of fertilizer within 
                the water. Remember, plants don't take in nutrients at the same rate, so if you “top off” your system (adding 
                some solution to the reservoir), then that can cause a build-up of certain minerals. When you change out the 
                solution entirely and use an EC meter, you'll help maintain the nutrients.If you don't have a filter for your 
                system yet, then add one now! Filters help prevent plant matter and debris from getting into the reservoir itself. 
                This will reduce your cleaning rate—a major help in maintaining the system. However, don't forget to clean the filter 
                often so that there's no pesky build-up.Probably one of the most important tips on how to maintain your hydroponic reservoir 
                has to do with its pH system. If the pH levels are off, that creates issues for the root systems and the plants. We suggest,
                especially for beginner hydroponic gardeners, setting up a system for how often you'll check pH levels—keep track of them too! 
                Typically, pH ranges should be between 5.5-6.5.</i></p>
